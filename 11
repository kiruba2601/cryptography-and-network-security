11. Write a C program for possible keys does the Playfair cipher have? Ignore the fact that some keys 
might produce identical encryption results. Express your answer as an approximate power of 2.
a. Now take into account the fact that some Playfair keys produce the same encryption results. How 
many effectively unique keys does the Playfair cipher have?

import math

# number of ways to choose 25 letters from 26
num_keys = math.comb(26, 25) * math.perm(25, 25)

print(f"Number of possible keys: {num_keys:.2E}")



Number of possible keys: 3.14E+44
